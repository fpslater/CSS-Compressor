A Ruby class that opens a CSS file, and does a simple

compression of it by removing all the blank lines, and lines

that are only comments.

 

  css_compressor = CSSCompressor.new(filename)

  css_compressor.compress_to(destination_filename)

 

Given file contents that look like this...

 
/* reset a few things */

body {

  margin: 0;

  padding: 0;

}

 

/* for the main content div */

#content {

  margin: 10px

}

 
It should compress down to...

 
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
#content {
  margin: 10px
}
